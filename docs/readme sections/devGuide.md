## üöÄ Introduction

### üìñ Overview

This application is a **web application** with a **SPA (Single Page Application)** architecture on the client side, developed with **Angular 19**.  
A SPA is an application where content and navigation are mainly managed on the client side, loading a single initial HTML page and dynamically updating views using JavaScript, without fully reloading the page on each interaction.

The **backend** is implemented with **Spring Boot**, providing a REST API that allows the frontend to interact with business logic and the database.

The **database** used is **MySQL**.

The architecture is **monolithic**, but separated into two main layers:

- **Client (frontend)**: Angular application running in the browser.
- **Server (backend)**: Spring Boot application exposing REST endpoints.
- **Database**: MySQL, accessed by the backend via JPA/Hibernate.

Communication between client and server occurs **exclusively** via **REST API** over HTTP.

## üß∞ Technology Stack

The application uses the following technologies for its execution:

### **Frontend**

- **[Angular 19](https://angular.io/)** ‚Äî A Single Page Application (SPA) framework used to build the client-side of the application. In this project, Angular manages the UI rendering, routing, and state management, allowing the user to interact with the system without full page reloads.
- **[RxJS](https://rxjs.dev/)** ‚Äî A library for reactive programming using observables. In this project, RxJS is used to handle asynchronous data streams from the backend, such as API calls.
- **[Zone.js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/zone.js?activeTab=readme)** ‚Äî A library that helps Angular detect changes in the application state by intercepting and tracking asynchronous operations, ensuring the UI updates automatically when data changes.

### **Backend**

- **[Spring Boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot)** ‚Äî  A Java-based framework that simplifies backend application development with pre-configured defaults and embedded server support. In this project, it handles REST API endpoints, request processing, and business logic.

    - **spring-boot-starter-web** ‚Äî  Provides the components required to build REST APIs and serve HTTP requests.
    - **spring-boot-starter-data-jpa** ‚Äî Enables integration with JPA and Hibernate for database access and object-relational mapping.
    - **spring-boot-devtools** ‚Äî Adds hot reload and development-time features to speed up backend development.
- **[MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/)** ‚Äî A relational database management system used to store persistent application data, including user information and business records.
- **MySQL Connector/J** ‚Äî The official JDBC driver that allows the Spring Boot backend to connect and interact with the MySQL database.

### **Testing**

- **[JUnit 5](https://junit.org/junit5/)** ‚Äî The primary framework for writing and running unit tests in the backend. Used to validate individual components of the application logic.
- **[Mockito](https://site.mockito.org/)** ‚Äî A mocking framework for creating fake objects in unit tests, allowing isolated testing of backend services without requiring real dependencies.
- **[Testcontainers](https://www.testcontainers.org/)** ‚Äî A Java library to run lightweight, disposable containers for integration testing. In this project, it is used to spin up MySQL instances during tests.
- **[Rest Assured](https://rest-assured.io/)** ‚Äî A Java DSL for testing REST APIs. Used to verify backend endpoints by simulating client requests and validating responses.
- **[Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io/)** ‚Äî A JavaScript test runner that executes frontend tests in real browsers, ensuring compatibility and correct behavior in a browser environment.
- **[Jasmine](https://jasmine.github.io/)** ‚Äî A behavior-driven testing framework for JavaScript. Used with Karma to write and structure frontend unit tests for Angular components and services.
- **[Playwright](https://playwright.dev/)** ‚Äî A framework for end-to-end testing. In this project, Playwright is used to simulate real user interactions with the Angular application and validate full workflows.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

### **Deployment Architecture**

The application follows a **monolithic** architecture with two main components deployed as separate processes:

1. **Frontend (Angular 19 SPA)**  
   - Runs in a Node.js-based development server during development and is built into static files for production.
   - Communicates exclusively with the backend via **HTTP** using a REST API.

2. **Backend (Spring Boot)**  
   - Runs as a standalone Java process (JAR) or within a servlet container.
   - Connects to a **MySQL** database for persistent data storage.
   - Exposes its functionality through a **REST API**.

**Communication Protocols:**

- **Frontend ‚Üí Backend:** HTTP REST calls in JSON format.
- **Backend ‚Üí Database:** JDBC protocol using the MySQL Connector/J driver.

### **REST API**

The backend REST API is defined using **OpenAPI** specification.  
A generated **HTML version** of the documentation is available for direct viewing on GitHub without executing the application:

## ‚úÖ Quality Assurance

### üß™ Backend

The backend has undergone several layers of automated testing to ensure reliability, maintainability, and correctness of the implemented features.

#### **Types of Test**

- **Unit Tests** ‚Äî Validating the logic of individual service classes in isolation.  
  - Example: `ApartmentService` tested using **Mockito** to mock the repository layer.
- **Integration Tests** ‚Äî Testing service behavior with a real database connection.  
  - Example: `ApartmentService` tested using **Testcontainers** with a **MySQL** container.
- **End-to-End (E2E) Tests** ‚Äî Validating the full API functionality from request to database.  
  - Example: API tested using **Testcontainers** with **MySQL** for persistence.

#### **Test Execution Metrics**

The following table summarizes the coverage report for the backend (generated using **JaCoCo**):

| Metric                | Value         |
|-----------------------|--------------|
| **Line Coverage**     | 73% (55/210 instructions missed) |
| **Branch Coverage**   | 100% (0/2 branches missed)        |
| **Number of Classes** | 6            |
| **Number of Methods** | 33 total, 11 missed              |

#### **Coverage Report Screenshot**

![Backend Coverage Report](/docs/coverage-report/backend.jpg)

### üß™ Frontend

It has been tested at three different levels: **unit testing**, **integration testing**, and **end-to-end (E2E) testing**.  
The goal of these tests is to ensure the correct functionality of individual components, service integration, and the overall user flow.

#### **Types of Test**

- **Unit Tests** ‚Äî Validating the logic of individual components in isolation using a virtual DOM and mocked services.  
  - Example: Testing `ApartmentListComponent` with mocked `ApartmentService` using **Jasmine** and **Karma**.  
- **Integration Tests** ‚Äî Testing component and service interactions using **TestBed** with a real database connection.  
  - Example: Testing `BookingComponent` with **TestBed** against a real **MySQL** instance.  
- **End-to-End (E2E) Tests** ‚Äî Validating the complete user flow in the browser.  
  - Example: Booking flow tested using **Playwright** from UI actions to backend responses.  

#### **Coverage Metrics - Unit & Integration Tests**

Frontend test coverage is generated using **Karma + Istanbul** with the command:

```bash
ng test --code-coverage
```

This generates a coverage report in `frontend/coverage/frontend` folder.

##### **Coverage Sumary**

|Type      |Coverage|
|----------|--------|
|Lines     | 100%   |
|Functions | 100%   |
|Branches  | 100%   |
|Statements| 100%   |

## üîÑ Development Process

The development of the application followed an **iterative and incremental process**, inspired by the **Agile Manifesto** principles.

Although the project does not strictly follow Scrum or Kanban, some **Extreme Programming (XP)** practices were applied, such as continuous integration, automated testing, and short development iterations.

---

## 1. Task Management

Task management was handled using **GitHub Issues** and **GitHub Projects**, supported by a **visual Kanban board**.  
This allowed clear tracking of requirements, prioritization of tasks, and progress monitoring.

- **GitHub Issues** ‚Üí Used to register bugs, enhancements, and new features.  
- **GitHub Projects (Kanban board)** ‚Üí Provided a visual workflow with columns such as *To Do*, *In Progress*, and *Done*.  

üì∏ *Example of GitHub Project board:*  
![GitHub Project Board](/docs/images/github_project.jpg)

---

## 2. Git Workflow

Version control was managed using **Git** with a **branching strategy** based on *feature branches*, *fix branches*, and *main branch protection*.

- **`main` branch** ‚Üí Stable branch, always deployable.  
- **Feature branches** (`feature/*`) ‚Üí Created for each new functionality.  
- **Fix branches** (`fix/*`) ‚Üí Created for bug resolution.  
- **Other branches** (`testing/*`, `ci/*`, `docs/*`) ‚Üí Used for upload documentation, testing, or workflow configuration.  
- **Pull Requests** ‚Üí Enforced code reviews and CI execution before merging.

---

## 3. Continuous Integration (CI)

The project used **GitHub Actions** for continuous integration.  
Two workflows were defined:

### üîπ Basic Quality Check

- Triggered on pushes to `feature/*`, `fix/*`, `testing/*`, and `ci/*`.
- Runs **basic unit tests** for both backend and frontend.  

**Jobs:**

- `backend-basic` ‚Üí Executes backend unit tests (`mvn test -Dtest='*UnitTest'`).
- `frontend-basic` ‚Üí Installs dependencies and runs frontend unit tests (`npm run test:unit`).  

---

### üîπ Full Quality Check

- Triggered on pull requests to `main`.  
- Executes **all test types** for both backend and frontend.  

**Jobs:**

- `backend-full`  
  - Runs **unit tests**, **integration tests**, and **end-to-end (E2E)** tests in Spring Boot.  

- `frontend-integration`  
  - Spins up a **MySQL container** and the backend.  
  - Runs **frontend integration tests** with a live database and backend.  

- `frontend-unit-e2e`  
  - Runs **frontend unit tests**.  
  - Starts the frontend server.  
  - Executes **Playwright E2E tests** in a real browser.
